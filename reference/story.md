## Early Curiosity (2012)

Sachin Nayi's journey with technology began in 2012 when his father purchased a USB internet dongle — a small, plug-and-play device that allowed internet access on a computer using a SIM card.

This was Sachin's first real exposure to the internet on a computer. While using the dongle, he discovered that it was carrier-locked, meaning SIM cards from other networks could not be used.

Driven by curiosity, he researched the problem online and found technical methods to unlock such devices. As he went deeper, he realized there were entire communities and websites dedicated to modem unlocking.

After gaining sufficient understanding, Sachin successfully unlocked his own device and then helped unlock modems for friends and people around him. This hands-on experimentation laid the foundation for his interest in practical technology problem-solving.

## First Website & Learning by Doing (2012–2014)

Encouraged by his growing technical confidence, Sachin decided to create a simple website to document and share modem-unlocking solutions.

Using Blogspot, he launched:
https://modemunlock4u.blogspot.com/

The website is still live today.

Through building and running this site, Sachin learned:
- Basic website creation
- Content publishing
- Understanding user problems
- How people search for technical solutions online

This phase was purely experimental, but it introduced him to real-world learning far beyond theory.

## First WordPress Website & Early Monetization (2015–2018)

In 2015, Sachin created his first WordPress website with a custom domain:
**Techuhow.com**

At the early stage of this project, his brother-in-law — **Aakar Sharma** (now his partner at Mindjek Technologies LLP) — trusted him and supported the initiative by purchasing the domain and hosting.

On Techuhow.com, Sachin published technology tutorials, tips, and how-to guides. Over time, the site began generating revenue through Google AdSense.

Through this project, he gained practical experience in:
- WordPress
- Content writing
- SEO fundamentals
- Website monetization
- Managing hosting and domains

In 2018, Sachin sold Techuhow.com via Flippa for approximately **₹2 lakh INR**, marking his first successful website exit and reinforcing his interest in building digital assets.

Alongside these, many smaller experimental sites and systems were built, tested, and iterated upon.
